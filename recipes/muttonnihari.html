<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Nihari is a traditional dish and quite popular in <strong>India and Pakistan</strong> originated in the <strong>late 18th century 
    during the last throes of the Mughal empire</strong>. Nihari comes from the word ‘Nahr’ which means early morning. 
    The authentic way of preparation involves slow cooking of the meat with bone marrow for hours, mostly overnight, 
    and then served early morning as a breakfast dish.Even though Nihari looks like a curry, it is mostly served 
    with bread like naan or kulcha and not with rice. The reason must be the consistency of the curry, which goes well with bread.
